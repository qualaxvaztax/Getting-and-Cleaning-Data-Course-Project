### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. This repository contains the following files:

1. **run_analysis.R**: R script for performing the all the cleaning processes necessary to transform the *test* and *train* datasets into tidy data, as well as summarizing its variables. To run the script, it is only necessary to set the working directory to the main folder containing both the *test* and *train* datasets, probably something like: ".../UCI HAR Dataset".
2. **CodeBook.md**: Markdown file containing the description of the project, the procedures carried out and the detail of the variables selected for the output dataset.
